<problem>
`fibonacci(n:int)` 함수를 작성하세요. 이 함수는 피보나치 수열에서 생성할 항의 개수를 나타내는 정수 `n`을 매개변수로 받아 다음을 반환합니다:
- `n`이 0 이하인 경우 'OOPS'
- `n`이 `1`인 경우 `1`
- `n`이 `2`인 경우 `1`
- 그 외의 경우, 피보나치 수열의 n번째 항을 반환합니다. 피보나치 수열은 각 숫자가 이전 두 숫자의 합인 수열입니다. 피보나치 수열 예시: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 ....
## 예시:
```
fibonacci(-3) => 'OOPS'
fibonacci(0) => 'OOPS'
fibonacci(1) =>1
fibonacci(2) => 1
fibonacci(5) => 5
fibonacci(10) => 55
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def fibonacci(n):
2.    if n <= 0:
3.        return "OOPS"
4.    elif n == 1 and n == 2:
5.        return 1
6.    elif n > 2:
7.        a = 1
8.        b = 1
9.        for i in range(3, n+1):
10.            c = a + b
11.            a = b
12.            b = c
13.        return b
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 4, the function checks whether `n` is equal to `1` and `2` at the same time, which is not possible. Consequently, the function will never return `1` as specified by the instructions.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `and` with `or` on line 4.

User: Hi, my program passes all test cases except the second and third. Can you help?
Assistant: Hi! Sure, what does the problem description say about these two cases?
	<alt>Hi! Sure, what is the value of `n` in these two cases?
	<alt>Hi! Sure, these two cases are exception cases according to the problem description. Where have you handled this exception?
	<alt>Hi! Sure, what is the output supposed to be for each of these cases?
User: I am not sure, how can I find that?
	<alt>It says to return `1` when `n` is equal to `1` and when `n` is equal to `2`
Assistant: What are the values of `n` for these two cases?
	<alt>There are 3 exceptional cases according to the problem description. Do these two test cases fall under any of those exceptions?
User: In the second test case, the value of `n` is `1` and in the third case `n` is `2`.
Assistant: Correct, what are we supposed to return for these values of `n`?
User: We are supposed to return `1`, and I handled these cases on lines 4 and 5.
Assistant: Ok, when does line 4 evaluate to true?
	<alt>Ok, for what value of `n` will line 5 be executed?
User: It evaluates to true if `n` is `1` and if it is `2`
Assistant: Will the value of `n` ever be `1` and `2` at the same time?
User: No, it can be either `1` or `2`, but never both at the same time.
	<alt>No, I see that it has to be either `1` or `2` instead of `1` and `2`. Is that the error?
Assistant: Correct! It is either `1` OR `2`, does your if statement check for that?
User: Oh, I see it now! Looks like my if statement will be true only when `n` is `1` and `2`, instead of when `n` is `1` or `2`. Will this be the correct approach?

1. def fibonacci(n):
2.    if n <= 0:
3.        return "OOPS"
4.    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
5.        return 1
6.    elif n > 2:
7.        a = 1
8.        b = 1
9.        for i in range(3, n+1):
10.            c = a + b
11.            a = b
12.            b = c
13.        return b
</code>
Assistant: That looks great! It now returns `1` when `n` is either `1` or `2`.
User: Thank you for explaining the difference between `or` and `and`!
Assistant: You're welcome!
